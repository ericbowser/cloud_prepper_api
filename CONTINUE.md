# Continue Tutorial Project

## Project Overview
This is a tutorial project demonstrating the core features of Continue, an AI-powered coding assistant for IDEs.

## Purpose
The project serves as an interactive guide to help users learn and practice:
- **Autocomplete**: Inline code suggestions as you type
- **Edit**: Quick code modifications using AI (Cmd/Ctrl + I)
- **Chat**: Ask questions and get help from an LLM (Cmd/Ctrl + J)
- **Agent**: Advanced AI assistance with tools to handle complex coding tasks

## Project Structure
- `continue_tutorial.py`: Main tutorial file with interactive examples and exercises

## Code Components

### Sorting Algorithms
The tutorial includes two bubble sort implementations:
- `sorting_algorithm(x)`: Basic bubble sort example used for Edit demonstration
- `sorting_algorithm2(x)`: Identical implementation used for Chat demonstration

Both functions:
- Take a list `x` as input
- Sort the list in ascending order using bubble sort algorithm
- Return the sorted list
- Have O(n²) time complexity

## How to Use This Tutorial
1. Follow the numbered instructions in each section of `continue_tutorial.py`
2. Practice using keyboard shortcuts (Tab, Cmd/Ctrl + I, Cmd/Ctrl + J)
3. Experiment with different AI features
4. Try asking Continue to modify or explain the code
